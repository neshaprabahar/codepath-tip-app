## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The code I currently have on the repo has the logic to save state, but I just wasn't able to get it to work. There is obviously a mistake, but I have exhausted every resource I know I had to try and fix it. I ran into problems with the Settings page's back button not working, so I implemented a custom option instead!
